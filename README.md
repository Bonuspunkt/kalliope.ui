alright

this is the most minimal version

- clone it
- run npm install
- configure your browser to use the proxy for http
- navigate to http://localhost:8000/ for modifying setting

if you are usign firefox try
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/toggle-proxy-51740/
so you can toggle it instant on/off
